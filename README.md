Holy scripture - a programmer view on world's largest religions
========================================================

Artists have visualized the holy events in paintings.
Poets have written verses by drawing inspiration from their religious experience.
And, though the good programmers are artists, and the best ones are poets, there has never been a program written to describe the spiritual beliefs of people... until now.

Sometimes it's much, much easier to explain something using OOP notions.
To say "Islam extends Christianity" is worth a thousand words.
Also, the postulates of a particular religion could be expressed as simple relationships between objects.
For example, the common sermons could be treated as validators, while some of the most eccentric religious demands are only to be expressed as a bunch of weird hacks :)

P.S. An author does not consider himself highly biased towards any religion, and feels it safe to say he's a Unitarian Universalist.
